## Main Objective

The core objective of this project is to develop a tool that brings a fresh and automated approach to the DJing process while retaining the artistry and expertise that a professional DJ would incorporate in a live set. This tool aims to create seamless, unique, and high-quality mixes by automating several aspects that were previously done manually.

## AI-Generated Cue Points

This feature stands as a cornerstone of the project, offering significant advancements over existing tools. The process involves:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a rich dataset from the Rekordbox collection where cue points have been manually selected.
- **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging specific beat timestamps and extracting relevant musical features for model training.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing the data to train an AI model that can generate 12 cue points on unseen songs, which facilitates high-quality mixing while preserving the musical structure.
- **Implementation**: Integrating the trained model into the generator to automatically select the best cue points for new songs.

## EQ Features

The EQ feature enables smoother transitions between songs by adjusting the frequencies during the crossfade, incorporating:

- **Algorithm Development**: Crafting algorithms that dynamically adjust the EQ settings to create seamless transitions.
- **Transition Timing**: Allowing for flexible transition times ranging from 1-3 minutes, enhancing the mixing experience.
- **User Interface**: Including user-adjustable settings for real-time modifications during a mix.

## Randomness and Authenticity

This aspect of the project focuses on bringing a sense of authenticity and spontaneity to the mixes, featuring:

- **Cue Point Selection**: Implementing a random selection mechanism for the initial cue points, thereby creating a unique starting point for each track.
- **Bass Swap Timing**: Introducing randomness in the bass swap timings to create an authentic and dynamic mixing experience.
- **Authenticity**: Ensuring that each mix generated is unique, emulating the variability and creativity seen in live DJ performances.

## Full Automation

The tool offers full automation, empowering users with greater control over the mixing process through:

- **Song Input**: Enabling users to input their preferred song files, offering more independence in song selection compared to other tools.
- **Mix Download**: Facilitating easy sharing and saving of mixes by allowing users to download the created mix directly to their device.
